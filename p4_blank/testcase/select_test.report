This test case tests the select function vigorously.
It starts by creating 2 tables: table1 and table2
It then selects * on both tables to see if all of the tuples output.
It then performs a simple select query to see if it will correctly print out 1 attribute.
It then prforms a query that prints out 2 attributes that are in the opposite order of which they are stored in the database to see if they are outputted in the correct order.
It the performs a query with an equality condition to make sure ScanSelect is used.
It then creates an index on table2.id2 and performs the same query to see if IndexScan is now used.
It then performs a query with a non-equality condition.
It the proceeds to test the different operators to make sure they work.
