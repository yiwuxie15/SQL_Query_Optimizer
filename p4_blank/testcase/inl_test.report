This test creates 2 tables: table1 and table2.
It selects * the tables to see what is in them.
It then creates an index on table1.id.
It then performs an equijoin to make sure INL is the algorithm used.
It then creates an index on table2.id2.
It then performs the same equijoin to make sure INL is the algorithm used.
It then drops the index on table1.id so that table2.id2 is the only index.
It then performs the same equijoin to make sure INL is the algorithm used.

The tables both have duplicates so the test case makes sure that the duplicates are not ignored.
